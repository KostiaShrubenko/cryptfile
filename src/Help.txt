Program "cryptfile" is intended to encrypt and decrypt files.
Also, it can check whether encrypted file has been corupted.
There are following options:

	-h 		-- 	prints this message.

	-e [key] 	-- 	this option tells that this time program should 
				perform encryption. It is followed by mandatory
				argument [key] which specifies key for encryption.
			
	-d [key]	--	this option tells that this time program should
				perform decryption with key which is [key].

	-s [file]	--	this option tells that its argument is path to
				file which about to be encrypted/decrypted.

	-f [file]	--	tells that its argument is path to file to which
				output should be stored. It can be omited then
				output will be stored to default location with
				name which consist of [prefix_sourcefile] and 
				extension [.bin].
				NOTE: it is not path to folder. The following is
				incorrect [\folder1\] it must be like [\folder1\file.bin]

NOTE: 	
	As folder separator must be used character "\". The following is incorrect [fol/fl/im.bin]
	Square brackets must be ommited.
	If [key] not large enough, zeros are appended to the right of the [key].
	If [key] larger then 32 bytes, it is truncated from the right.
	Option [-e] and [-d] cant be written at the same time.
	Each execution of program, except for "help" routin, demands option [-s] to be specified.
	Orrder of options doesn't matter.

EXAMPLES:
	-s image.jpg -e key
	-f ..\folder\decrypted_image.jpg -d key -s encrypted_image.bin
