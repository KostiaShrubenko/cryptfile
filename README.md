To compile my project just open command line and type: "gmake install"

NOTE: the default compiler set as "gcc". If you dont have it in your PATH variables,
you have to open "Makefile" and assign to "CC" path to your compiler. The same with make application,
the default is "gmake", you can change it in variable "MAKE" it is needed to compile external modules.


To test program you can use image.jpg
